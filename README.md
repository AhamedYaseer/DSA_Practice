# DSA Practice (Python)

This repository contains my practice solutions for Data Structures and Algorithms.
Each problem is solved in a structured way, starting with a brute force solution
and then optimized using efficient techniques.

## Language
- Python

## Repository Structure
Problems are organized by topic (as of now):
- Arrays

Each folder contains:
- Individual problem files
- A short README describing common patterns used in that topic

## Problem-Solving Approach
1. Understand the problem clearly
2. Write a brute force solution
3. Analyze time and space complexity
4. Optimize using appropriate patterns
5. Document the approach and learning

## Goal
To build strong problem-solving skills and pattern recognition
for coding interviews through consistent practice.
